[Priority]

1. Check for making a global script for interactable nature resources (Fruit Bush, Water...);
2. Make certain tools limited to being usable to gather only resources within its utility.

[Ideas/Optional]

1. Make resource gathering degradable as you gather them (i.e a stone drops rocks as it's damaged);
2. Add a jornal that adds information about the things the player discovers/sees/goes through inside the game;
3. Fix the axe animation not resseting to its original starting position.

[Notes]

1. A day/night cycle takes 9 minutes.
